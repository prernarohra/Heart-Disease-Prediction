# :anatomical_heart:  Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the possibiltiy of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters using machine learning algorithms. The model uses historical health data to make predictions that can assist in early diagnosis.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Flask / Streamlit (for web application, if applicable)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various health parameters such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target Variable (Presence of Heart Disease)

### Note

Make sure to preprocess the dataset before training the model. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

## Features

- Input health metrics to predict heart disease risk.
- Model trained on various algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to find the most accurate model.
- Visualization of data and model performance metrics.
- (Optional) Web application for user input and predictions using Flask or Streamlit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
